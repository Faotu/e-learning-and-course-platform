Sincerely, I forgot about getting married self. Because I don’t have any means to sustain myself. Until June 2021. The same year I took this Work and Shine Program, I got a client that paid me up to 500 thousand Naira (he actually paid in dollars) Monthly and I was able to fund my wedding with 2 million Naira. All from my own work. No loan, no family contribution.",
